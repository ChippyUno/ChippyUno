## Data Science Projects
My name is James Chen and I major in Finance. For my interests outside of school, I enjoy Fencing, Cooking, listening to music, and exploring the world. 

**Current Projects**: In this section I will present all Data Science related projects and research, primarily focused on data visualization. 

**Skills**: Python, R, various Data Visualization tools, Regression. 

**Goals**: By the end of the semester, I hope I will be more proficient in coding skills. Additionally, I would love to learn any thing that broadens my knowledge in Data Science
